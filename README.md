# Stock_Analysis

# Purpose
The purpose is to perform analysis on different stocks and their performances in year 2017 and 2018. A macro was created in VBA to output calculations for our analysis. An interface was created to allow users to perform these basic functions with the click of a button.

# Results
Below, we see the two stock analysis for both years. The "Total Daily Volume" (which refers to the number of trades of a particular stock) is summed over the course of the year. In the "Return" column, the stocks' price at the end of the year is divided by the price at the beginning of the year and converted to show percentage gain or loss. This indicates the return on investment for a specific stock for the investor with green indicating gains and red indicating losses.
